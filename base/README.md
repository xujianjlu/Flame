base
====

A powerful C++ base lib.

This part of code is a general infrastructure base/common lib for all projects.  
It offers you the basic operations with C++, wrap the functions which you can use everywhere,  
free you from coding the basic modules again and again.    

**How many times you blame**, that why you can't use C++ just like java or python ?  
**How many times you blame**, that why does C++ forces you to do everything yourself ?  
even the basic operations like 'string split', 'file operations', and so on?

**Now, you got one !**
